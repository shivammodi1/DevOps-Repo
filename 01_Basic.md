# What is DevOps?
- It is work as a bridge between Development and Operations teams
- It provides the high quality software delivery quickly and reliably
- Here We can automate testing, integration, deployment processes
- It focuses on collaboration, communication, and integration between software developers and IT operations

# Life-Cycle of DevOps
```          Dev                                               Ops
   +------------------------------------------------+
   |                                                |
   |                                                v
  Plan -> Code -> Build -> Test -> Release -> Deploy -> Operate -> Monitor
   ^                                                |
   |                                                |
   +------------------------------------------------+
```
- Plan -> Code -> Build -> Test -> Release -> Deploy -> Operate -> Monitor-> Plan

- It is a continuous process that involves multiple stages
- Each stage has its own set of tools and practices

# Key Prnciples of DevOps

```Collaboration```
- Development and Operations teams work together throughout the software development lifecycle.

```Automation```
- Automate repetitive tasks such as testing, integration, and deployment to improve efficiency and reduce errors.

```Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)```
- It will ensure that CI/Cd pipelines work effectuvely to deliver code changes quickly and reliably.

```Monitoring and Feedback```
- Monitor applications and infrastructure to identify issues and gather feedback for improvement.


# Role of DevOps Engineer
- They are responsible for implementing and managing DevOps practices within an organization.
- They work closely with development and operations teams to ensure smooth software delivery.
- They also manage CI/CD pipelines, automate processes, and monitor applications and infrastructure.
